# Abstractive and Extractive Text Summarization with UI  
extractive text summarization was learnt and taken from   https://dev.to/davidisrawi/build-a-quick-summarizer-with-python-and-nltk  
Abstractive tect summarization was taken and modified to fit our application from  
#1  The data set used to check the summarization accuracy is a food reviews dataset  
#2  contains speech tp text  
#3  pdf reader and converter  
#4  contains text to speech  
#5  mp3 to text conversion using ffmpeg  
#6  recursive neural network training for abstractive text summarization  
#7  extractive text summarization  
#8  pre trained model if needed    
#9  UI using tkinter to run it as a software
  
pre-trained model for Abstractive Text are:  
best_model.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001  
best_model.ckpt.index    
best_model.ckpt.meta
